### Hi there, i'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack engineer that enjoys building new things and experimenting with different ways to use technology.

When I am not sat in front of my computer, I like to get outdoors and have a real adventure, hiking, mountaineering, adventure racing etc.

My current focus is on all things JavaScript/TypeScript & NodeJS, with a little Python thrown in for good measure.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple social innovation projects and building my own business.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the latest machine learning approaches.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any innvoation projects that have a social aspect.
